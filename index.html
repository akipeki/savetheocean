<h4 class="text-section-header1">To create change, it’s going to take action at all levels.</h4>
<p class="text-section-regular-text">Our home planet has a deeply disturbing and pervasive problem with plastics. In April 2022, a group of researchers studying the deepest part of the ocean—the Mariana Trench—discovered plastic bags and candy wrappers floating nearly seven miles below the surface of the Pacific Ocean. Globally, about 450 million metric tons of plastic are produced every year and 9.5 million tons of plastic are thrown into the ocean annually, most of it single-use. Both these numbers are on the rise. A report from the Ellen MacArthur Foundation says by 2050 there will be more plastic in the oceans than there are fish (by weight). But the problem goes beyond using petroleum as a source for raw material. Burning fossil fuels to create those synthetic materials is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Those emissions warm the planet, increase ocean acidification and release harmful—sometimes toxic—air pollutants.</p>
<br>
<h4 class="text-section-header2">Every piece of plastic ever made is still on the planet.</h4>
<p class="text-section-regular-text">Plastic persists in our environment indefinitely unless it's been incinerated or launched into space via satellite or spacecraft. Less than 10 percent of plastic in the US is actually recycled, 16 percent is burned, and the rest piles up in landfills, releasing greenhouse gases, impacting wildlife habitats and posing a risk to air and water quality.</p>

  <h1>FAQ</h1>
<div class="accordion" id="section1">How we can create a change?</div>
<div class="panel">
  <p class="regular-text-accordion">
    We’ve made strides to reduce our reliance on virgin plastics and are taking new steps to address the plastics we use in our products, but we can’t do it alone. Changing industry practices requires action on the individual, business and government levels. 
  </p>

<div class="accordion" id="section2">
  What you can do?
</div>
<div class="panel">
  <p class="regular-text-accordion">
    Simply put, buy less and demand more. Reject the concept of fast fashion, buy responsibly made and durable gear only when needed and shop used if possible—then wear it, repair it and pass it on once you no longer need it.

    But the activism doesn’t end in your closet. Ask your favorite brands how they’re thinking about their plastic use and what they’re doing to mitigate it. Are they switching to renewable energy sources? Prioritizing recycled materials? Being transparent about their supply chain and footprint?
    
    Come election time, use the power of your vote. Elect leaders who are committed to addressing the climate crisis through targeted measures like cutting fossil fuel subsidies and investing in green energy.

<div class="accordion" id="section3">What businesses can do?</div>
<div class="panel">
  <p class="regular-text-accordion">
    Shifting an entire industry calls for collaboration. We share the names of many of our supply chain partners so other companies can invest in those secondary waste streams and amplify the effort. Other tangible steps include eliminating virgin petroleum sources from products, aligning with financial partners who are committed to a global energy transition and supporting grassroots organizations whose communities are most impacted by the climate crisis.
  </p>

<div class="accordion" id="section4">What governments can do?</div>
<div class="panel">
  <p class="regular-text-accordion">
    Building and scaling broader, more meaningful legislation and regulation is critical to creating systemic change in the way our clothes are made, transported and treated after they’ve been worn. Measures like decreased tariffs for recycled and organic materials, documenting and disclosing supply chains (where clothes are made and who is making them), and incentives for companies who adopt materials from organic or recycled inputs won’t just create transparency. These laws and regulations would hold companies accountable for their impact and drive the urgent changes that the industry needs.
